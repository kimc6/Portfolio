           Hi! My name is Christi Kim. I am a rising senior at the Bronx High School of Science and I live in New York City. 
           My favorite fruits during the summer are pineapples and watermelons, but my favorite fruits during the school year are bananas and oranges. 
           I love to aimlessly walk around and my favorite type of stores are ones that are a "one of a kind", bookstores, stationary stores, and thriftstores. 
           I am great lover of a lot of things, but I am not a huge fan of sweets, waking up in the mornings, and bugs.
           My favorite webpages are Instagram, Youtube, and my doodle site.
